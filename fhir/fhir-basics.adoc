= FHIR

FHIR is a standard for health care data exchange, published by HL7®. +

FHIR is an interoperability standard intended to facilitate the exchange of healthcare information between healthcare providers, patients, caregivers, payers, researchers, and any one else involved in the healthcare ecosystem. It consists of 2 main parts – a content model in the form of ‘resources’, and a specification for the exchange of these resources in the form of real-time RESTful interfaces as well as messaging and Documents. +

The standard is available at http://hl7.org/fhir[fhir] +

== HL7 Standard
Health level 7 - Analogous to OSI layer 7 applications layer. +
HL 7 provides framework to facilitate this interoperability through standard messaging formats and protocols. +
HL7 FHIR enables medical organisations to exchange, store, integrate and retrieve the global health data across systems while ensuring security and interoperability +
