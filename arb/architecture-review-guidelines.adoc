## 4. Operational Excellence
Operational Excellence refers to the ability of the system to operate efficiently, reliably and securely

.This can be achieved by adopting practices such as:
* Automating Operations
* Monitoring system performance
* Continuously improving processes

.Example: If an organisation uses AWS, they can use below services:
* AWS CloudFormation for automating deployment of resources
* AWS CloudWatch to monitor system performance
* AWS Trusted Advisor to provide recommendations for improving system operations



## 5. Cost Optimization
.Cost Optimization refers to measures taken to optimise the cost across:
 * Resource Utilization CPU, Memory and Storage
 * Infrastructure Provisioning
 * Licensing

How to Achieve?

.This can be achieved by following the below practices:
 * Using Spot and/or reserved instances instead of  other instance types like on-demand.
 * Sizing the resources right
 * Adapting the serverless architecture/managed services of the cloud that can be scaled up od down as needed. Elastic in nature. This allows greater efficiency, cost effectiveness and flexibility in the system
